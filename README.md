# Football Analysis System 

This project is an introduction to machine learning techniques for me, a huge learning curve. It is a Python-based football tracking system designed to monitor player, referee and ball movements in real-time during football matches. It leverages advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to enhance the analysis of football games.

## Technologies used 

- Python 3.8
- Ultralytics YOLO for object detection
- ByteTrack for object tracking
- OpenCV for image processing

## Datasets models are trained on:

Note: Repo currently has only essential files, training files too large for GitHub.
